 About me
I always strive to improve myself and love to learn new things that I had never encountered before. I also believe that my trait as a fast learner will help me catch up with new technologies that are constantly evolving.

🌱 I’m currently learning ...
C#
.NET Framework

👯 I’m looking forward to collaborate on open source projects.
✔ Ask me about anything, I am happy to talk with everyone!😉
Outside tech, 📖 I love to read novels, 🖌️ do painting and skecthing, 🎵 listen to music, and 🌴 explore nature outdoors.
